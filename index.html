      <em>GRAPA</em> (short for GRAdual Proof Assistants) is an associate team
      between the Inria Project-Team
      <a href="https://gallinette.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/">Gallinette</a>,
      led by <a href="https://tabareau.fr/">Nicolas Tabareau</a>, and the
      <a href="https://www.pleiad.cl">PLEIAD</a> laboratory of the University of
      Chile, led by <a href="https://pleiad.cl/etanter/">Ã‰ric Tanter</a>.

    <p>
      <em>GRAPA</em> aims at extending the reach of gradual typing to
      full-fledged type theories in order to support smooth certified
      programming in a new generation of proof assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically, our current objectives are organized around two axes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc text-justify">
      <li>
        Internal Reasoning about Precision and Graduality: we will further
        develop the ideas of internalizing precision and graduality, building
        upon recent work on observational equality, and extending to other
        gradual variants of CIC (e.g. with global graduality) in order to
        demonstrate its benefits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implementations of Gradual Type Theory: To this date, all advances in
        gradual dependent types and gradual type theory have been essentially
        theoretical: there is no implementation of GDTL or GCIC. We aim at
        addressing this gap, towards usable implementations of gradual type
        theories for a new generation of proof assistants.
      </li>
    </ul>
